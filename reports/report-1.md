# Deprivation and GP Quality Outcome Payments

### Executive Summary
This project will look at the NHS’s voluntary Quality & Outcome Framework (QOF)

_“QOF rewards GP practices for the provision of 'quality care' and helps to fund further improvements in the delivery of clinical care. QOF points are achieved based on the proportions of patients on defined disease registers who receive defined interventions”_ (NHS Digital, 2023)

In 2023 the Health Equity Evidence Centre published a compelling online article called “Structural inequalities in primary care – the facts and figures” (Appel and Ford, 2023). This examined QOF and included the graph in figure 1.1 which appears to indicate more deprived GP practices achieve less QOF points. Thus QOF does not reduce inequality.
